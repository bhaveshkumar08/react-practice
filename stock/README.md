Created a small project, which fetched the stock price of the company if you provide the api url in the input text filled. 
It adds that stock to the page and then you can add more stock prices by adding the api urls. 
Also used style to show “green” and “red” color if the price of the stock goes up and low.
Used axios for api calls.
